Algebra;Conditional Random Fields (CRFs);Conditional Random Fields are a class of probabilistic models used for structured prediction tasks, such as sequence labeling and segmentation, by modeling the conditional probability distribution of output variables given input features, commonly used in natural language processing, computer vision, and bioinformatics.
Calculus;Stochastic Gradient Boosting;Stochastic Gradient Boosting is a variant of Gradient Boosting that introduces randomness by subsampling the training data and features at each iteration, improving generalization and reducing overfitting, commonly used in machine learning for its efficiency and scalability with large datasets.
Geometry;Isometry;Isometry is a transformation that preserves distances and angles between points, commonly used in geometry and topology to study symmetries, congruence, and invariant properties of geometric objects, such as translations, rotations, and reflections.
Trigonometry;Independent Subspace Analysis (ISA);Independent Subspace Analysis is a variant of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) used to decompose a mixed signal into statistically independent subspaces rather than independent components, commonly used in blind source separation, signal processing, and data representation.
Algebra;Gaussian Processes;Gaussian Processes are a family of stochastic processes used to model distributions over functions, providing a probabilistic framework for regression and uncertainty estimation, commonly used in Bayesian optimization, spatial statistics, and machine learning for regression and probabilistic modeling.
